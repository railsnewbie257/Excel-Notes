CAUTION: Many VBA-based computer viruses propagate themselves by creating and/or modifying VBA code. Therefore, many virus scanners may automatically and without warning or confirmation delete modules that reference the VBProject object, causing a permanent and irretrievable loss of code. Consult the documentation for your anti-virus software for details.
